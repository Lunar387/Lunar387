- Hi!
- I am a Masters student at IIT Bombay, India
- These are the codes for obtaining the plots in my master's thesis - stage 1

- I have generated Microcanonical Thermal Pure Quantum states, as prescribed by Sugiura and Shimizu.
- Then I have found out the magnetization, correlation function and Temperature using these pure states

- System used is a Heisenberg spin chain, with a magnetic field along the z direction
- My thesis is not online, will link to it when it is done.
